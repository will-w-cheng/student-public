# Corrections

## Question 1
- ![Question 1](https://files.catbox.moe/3a3yzg.png)
- I misread the question and happened to read that there were only 3 one's which resulted in me thinking it would be 128 + 64 + 32 = 224 as the value for the last number. In the future I should make sure I double check my work and answers, practicing more will help me become more detail orientated. 

## Question 2
- ![Question 2](https://files.catbox.moe/1z0f4j.png)
- Here I picked the right condition but I think I accidentally read the sign as the wrong sign and thus I swapped it to be the wrong condition. Again, it's just detail orientation

## Question 3
- ![Question 3](https://files.catbox.moe/blvu5o.png)
- I should have realized that there were multiple choices that I could pick. If Y is negative, then the loop should never get executed and the count would return the unintended value of 0.
