# Requirements
- Exceptional achievement.  93% or better in last trimester of CompSci.
![94](https://files.catbox.moe/qagvfy.png)
- Exemplar in Team work. I usually try and help other people when I can and help out people whenever I'm free and able to work on stuff for other people. One big point that I think I've improved on Trimester 2 is teaching people.
