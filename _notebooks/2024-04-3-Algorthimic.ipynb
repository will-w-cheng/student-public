    "# Types of sorting\n",
    "\n",
    "## Insertion Sort\n",
    "- Insertion sorting in this example, included a bunch of different pool noodle lengths. The goal is to sort the noodle lengths in order. \n",
    "- You go through down the list, in this example you can insert the corresponding pool noodles based on the sizes of the previous elements.\n",
    "- The worst possible case time scenario is O(N^2) because you might have a nested for loop to sort the element, thus it's not the fastest possible way to sort but it's a method. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Quick sort\n",
    "- The pivot splits the array into two different arrays, one that is bigger goes into a bigger array, and the smaller one goes into the smaller sort. This process continues through rrecursion\n",
    "- O(n*(log(n))) insanely quickly\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bubble sort\n",
    "- Worst case o(n^2) best case is o(n)\n",
    "- Almost basically the same thing as insertion sort but it only looks at the one previous behind it. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Merge sort\n",
    "- O(log * (n))\n",
    "- Split the lists in half repeatedly until each list is split into a group of two\n",
    "- Then that moves onto combining a group of four and then sorts within there continously having bigger groups of lists until the whole thing is sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Selection Sort\n",
    "- Loop through the list in each sub-selection and place the the minimum in the beginning ofo the list in order to sort it. Then you can take the unsorted sub-selections of the list out to fix it. \n",
    "- O(N^2) time complexity"
