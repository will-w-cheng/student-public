    "- Architectural style for designing networked applications\n",
    "- Set of rules and conventions for building and interacting with web services that adhere to the principles of REST.\n",
    "\n",
    "Principals of REST-\n",
    "- Statelessness: Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and fulfill the request. The server should not store any information about the client's state between requests. This makes the system scalable and easy to maintain.\n",
    "- Client-Server Architecture: The client and server are separate entities that communicate over a network. The client is responsible for the user interface and user experience, while the server is responsible for processing requests, managing resources, and handling business logic.\n",
    "- Uniform Interface: RESTful APIs have a uniform and consistent interface, which simplifies the architecture and promotes a clear separation of concerns. The uniform interface is defined by several constraints, including resource identification through URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers), resource manipulation through representations, and self-descriptive messages.\n",
    "- Representation: Resources can have multiple representations, such as JSON or XML, which can be selected based on the client's needs or capabilities. The representation contains the current state of the resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "### REST APIs and JWT:\n",
    "\n",
    "A Java Web Token (JWT) is often used in the context of RESTful APIs to secure and authenticate communication between clients and servers.\n",
    "- Authentication and Authorization: When a client makes a request to a RESTful API, the server may need to verify the identity of the client and determine whether the client has the necessary permissions to perform the requested operation. JWTs can be used to securely transmit authentication information (such as user identity and roles) between the client and server.\n",
    "- Stateless Communication: RESTful APIs typically follow the stateless constraint, meaning that each request from the client to the server should contain all the information needed to understand and fulfill the request. JWTs provide a way to include authentication and authorization information directly within the token, eliminating the need for the server to store session state.\n",
    "- Token-Based Authentication: Instead of relying on sessions and cookies, which are commonly used in traditional web applications, JWTs allow for token-based authentication. When a user logs in, the server issues a JWT containing relevant user information and a signature to ensure its integrity. The client then includes this token in the headers of subsequent requests, allowing the server to authenticate and authorize the user.\n",
    "- Secure Transmission: JWTs can be signed and, optionally, encrypted, providing a secure way to transmit information between the client and server. The server can verify the integrity of the token by checking its signature, ensuring that the information it contains has not been tampered with."

    "\n",
    "Postman serves as a valuable tool in the realm of computer science, specifically designed for testing and interacting with Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Postman can be likened to a sophisticated testing environment that facilitates the exploration of API functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within Postman, users can craft and dispatch HTTP requests to APIs, allowing for a comprehensive examination of how different software components communicate and respond. This tool is instrumental in ensuring the seamless integration of APIs into software applications. Its intuitive interface provides a user-friendly platform to engage in the essential practice of testing and validating API behavior.\n",

    "### Postman and JWT:\n",
    "\n",
    "Postman allows you to include JWTs in your requests easily. Here's different ways of how you can use Postman to send a request with a JWT:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Authorization Tab\n",
    "- Open your request in Postman.\n",
    "- Go to the \"Authorization\" tab.\n",
    "- Select \"Bearer Token\" from the \"Type\" dropdown.\n",
    "- Paste your JWT token in the \"Token\" field.\n",
    "2. Headers:\n",
    "- Enter the JWT in the headers manually using the \"Headers\" tab by adding a key-value pair like Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, Postman enables you to simulate API requests with JWTs, ensuring that your authentication mechanisms are working as expected. If everything is working as expected, you will recieve a status code in the 2xx range (e.g., 200 OK) which typically indicates success. If you do not recieve a 200 OK message, Postman will let you know what is wrong so you can catch errors in your code. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Postman and Cookies:\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to JWT, Postman allows you to manage cookies as efficently. Here's different ways you can work with cookies in Postman:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Cookies Tab:\n",
    "- Open your request in Postman.\n",
    "- Navigate to the \"Cookies\" tab.\n",
    "- Add the necessary cookies by providing the key-value pairs.\n",
    "2. Headers:\n",
    "- Cookies can also be included in the request headers manually."
